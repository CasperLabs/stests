Casper Labs System Test Platform


What is stests ?
--------------------------------------

stests stands for system tests.  It's goal is to encapsulate very large system testing of the CLX network.


Why stests ?
--------------------------------------

Launching a blockchain network within a hostile permission-less setting is non-trivial.  The elevated risk profile of such an undertaking must be matched by a concomitant level of sophistication in respect of system testing.  At the core of such testing will be a test platform, i.e. stests, whose underlying strategic objective is to progressively constrain network behaviour to that of a successful production setting, i.e. main net.


Who uses stests ?
--------------------------------------
